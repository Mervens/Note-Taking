## Description  
This assignment was to use Express.js to create the backend for a note taking app. The user writes information onto a note, it gets transferred to a .json and then returns as a saved note.

## How It Works  

**Install the needed packages in the terminal using:**

`npm install`

**Then run this in the terminal:**

`node server.js`
